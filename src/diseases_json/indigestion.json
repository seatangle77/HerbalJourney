      "zh": "消化不良是指消化过程中出现的问题，导致胃部不适、腹胀、腹痛、恶心或反酸等症状。消化不良可以由多种因素引起，包括饮食不当、过度饮酒、压力大、某些药物的副作用或消化系统疾病。在中医理论中，消化不良可能与脾胃虚弱、湿阻中焦、食积内停等有关，治疗通常侧重于健脾和胃、调理气机、消食导滞。",
      "en": "Indigestion refers to problems in the digestive process that lead to stomach discomfort, bloating, abdominal pain, nausea, or acid reflux. It can be caused by various factors, including improper diet, excessive alcohol consumption, stress, side effects of certain medications, or digestive system diseases. In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), indigestion may be related to weakness of the spleen and stomach, damp obstruction in the middle burner, or food stagnation, with treatments focusing on strengthening the spleen and stomach, regulating qi, and eliminating food stagnation."
